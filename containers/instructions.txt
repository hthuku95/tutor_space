Yes, We can now continue with the next component. and please include where the files should be located

Let's create the Service Generator class next. This class will be responsible for generating all necessary service files and configurations based on the validated project configuration.

Service Generator
Click to open code
Additionally, we should create a starter template:


Health Check Template
Click to open code
This setup provides:

A comprehensive ServiceGenerator class in /agents/project/generators/service_generator.py
A template system under /agents/project/generators/templates/
Methods for generating:
Dockerfiles
Frontend files (React/Vue/etc)
Backend files (Python/Node/etc)
Database configurations
Environment files
Health check scripts
The ServiceGenerator works with:

The types defined in /agents/project/types.py
The validation from /agents/project/validators.py
Would you like me to:

Create more templates for specific service types
Move on to implementing the Project Manager class
Something else?
"""
Above is the two last messages on a chat between me and you in this project. 
We were in the process of extending the e App Generation functionality
to handle complex application generation with multiple services, proper Docker management, 
and integration with the AI Agent system, particularly Agent 4 which handles programming tasks.
The last file you had generated was the service_generator.py file and you were getting started 
with creating the Health Check Template, and here is what you had generated so far:
"""
#!/bin/sh
set -e

HOST="${HOST:-localhost}"
PORT="${PORT:-{{ config.port }}}"
ENDPOINT="{{ config.endpoint }}"
TIMEOUT="{{ config.timeout }}"

if wget --spider -q --tries=1 --timeout=$TIMEOUT http://$HOST:$PORT$ENDPOINT; then
    exit 0
else
    exit 1
fi
"""
First of all, I dont know where the Health Check Template file would go, or any of the other 
templates for the specific service types that you were asking me permission to create would go. 
After all this your next step was to implement the Project Manager Class. I want you to continue from here and 
complete the process of extending the App Generation functionality to handle more complex tasks.
