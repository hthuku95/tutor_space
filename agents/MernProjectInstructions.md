# Ticket Management Web App Project Requirements

## Project Overview
We're looking to develop a fullstack Ticket Management web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The application should be containerized using Docker and deployed on AWS.

## Functional Requirements

### User Management
1. User registration and login system
2. Role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Support Agent, Customer)
3. User profile management

### Ticket Management
1. Ticket creation with fields for title, description, priority, and category
2. Ability to assign tickets to support agents
3. Ticket status tracking (New, In Progress, On Hold, Resolved, Closed)
4. Ticket commenting system for communication between agents and customers
5. File attachment support for tickets (max 5MB per file)
6. Ticket search and filtering capabilities

### Dashboard
1. Overview dashboard for admins and managers showing key metrics:
   - Total tickets
   - Open tickets
   - Average resolution time
   - Agent performance metrics
2. Personal dashboard for support agents showing their assigned tickets

### Reporting
1. Generate reports on ticket resolution times, agent performance, and common issues
2. Export reports in CSV and PDF formats

### Notification System
1. Email notifications for ticket updates
2. In-app notifications for new assignments and updates

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend (React.js)
1. Responsive design, mobile-friendly
2. Use of a modern UI library (e.g., Material-UI, Ant Design)
3. State management using Redux or Context API
4. Form validation using Formik or React Hook Form

### Backend (Node.js & Express.js)
1. RESTful API design
2. JWT authentication
3. Rate limiting and request validation
4. Logging system for tracking errors and user actions

### Database (MongoDB)
1. Proper data modeling for tickets, users, and comments
2. Indexing for improved query performance
3. Data validation at the database level

### DevOps
1. Dockerization of both frontend and backend
2. CI/CD pipeline setup (preferably using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI)
3. Deployment on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service)
4. Use of AWS S3 for file storage
5. Implementation of auto-scaling based on load

### Security
1. HTTPS implementation
2. Input sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
3. CSRF protection
4. Secure storage of sensitive information (use AWS Secrets Manager)

### Performance
1. Implement caching strategy (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data
2. Optimize database queries for large datasets
3. Implement pagination for list views

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. The system should handle up to 1000 concurrent users
2. Page load times should not exceed 3 seconds
3. 99.9% uptime SLA
4. All API endpoints should respond within 500ms under normal load

## Deliverables
1. Source code in a private GitHub repository
2. Comprehensive documentation including:
   - API documentation
   - Database schema
   - Deployment instructions
   - User manual
3. Docker compose file for local development setup
4. AWS architecture diagram
5. Test cases and test results

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: Planning, design, and project setup
- Week 3-4: Core functionality development (user management, ticket CRUD operations)
- Week 5-6: Advanced features (dashboard, reporting, notifications)
- Week 7: Testing and bug fixes
- Week 8: Deployment, documentation, and project handover

## Communication
- Weekly progress reports via email
- Bi-weekly video call for demo and feedback
- Use of project management tool (e.g., Jira, Trello) for task tracking

## Budget
The total budget for this project is $4000, payable in milestones:
1. 25% upon project kickoff
2. 25% at midpoint review (end of Week 4)
3. 25% upon completion of all features and successful testing
4. 25% upon successful deployment and project handover

Please provide a detailed breakdown of how you plan to allocate this budget across different phases of the project.

## Additional Notes
- Code quality is crucial. We expect clean, well-commented, and maintainable code.
- We're open to suggestions for improving the project based on your expertise.
- After the initial development, we may discuss a maintenance contract for ongoing support and feature additions.
